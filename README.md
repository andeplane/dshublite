# DSHubLite

[JupyterLite](https://github.com/jupyterlite/jupyterlite) is a JupyterLab distribution that **runs entirely in the browser** built
from the ground-up using JupyterLab components and extensions. DSHubLite is Cognite's modified version, with preinstalled Cognite SDK and soon tutorial notebooks.
